# Overview
Earth is the only known world with surface liquid water and life. It has a nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere, active geology, and a large Moon that stabilizes axial tilt.

# Physical Properties
- Mean radius: ~6,371.0 km
- Mass: ~5.972 × 10^24 kg
- Surface gravity: ~9.81 m/s^2
- Density: ~5.51 g/cm^3
- Rotation period (sidereal): ~23 h 56 m; solar day ~24 h
- Equatorial daylight duration: ~12 h at equinox (varies by season/latitude)
- Axial tilt: ~23.44°
- Surface temperature: global mean ~288 K (~15 °C); varies widely by region/season

# Orbit
- Semi-major axis: 1 AU (~149.6 million km)
- Orbital period: ~365.256 days (sidereal year)
- Eccentricity: ~0.0167
- Inclination: ~0° (by definition of ecliptic)
- Mean distance from Sun: 1 AU

# Atmosphere
~78% N2, ~21% O2, ~1% Ar and trace gases; variable H2O vapor.

# Composition (bulk)
Silicate mantle and crust over an iron core; extensive hydrosphere (liquid water covers ~71% of surface) and biosphere.

# Weather & Climate
Dynamic weather driven by solar heating and oceans; jet streams, cyclones, monsoons, and regional climate zones.

# Moons & Rings
One natural satellite (the Moon); no rings.

# Exploration
Extensive Earth-observing satellites; Apollo program explored the Moon.

# Notable Facts
- Liquid water covers ~71% of the surface; plate tectonics recycles the crust.

# Weight Of 1 kg Earth Mass
- Scale reading: 1.00 kgf (reference)

# Q&A
- Q: Why is Earth habitable?
  A: Temperate orbit, protective atmosphere/magnetosphere, and long-term water cycle.
- Q: How long is Earth’s year?
  A: About 365.25 days (sidereal ~365.256 days).
