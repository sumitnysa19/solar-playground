# Contents
- Star: Sun
- Terrestrial planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars
- Earth’s Moon: The Moon
- Gas giants: Jupiter, Saturn
- Ice giants: Uranus, Neptune
- Dwarf planet: Pluto

# Quick Comparisons
- Inner vs. outer planets: rocky vs. gas/ice giants; few vs. many moons; no rings vs. ring systems.
- Atmospheres: thin-to-dense among terrestrials (Mercury exosphere → Venus dense CO2), H/He-dominated in giants.
- Rotation: fast on gas giants, slow/varied on terrestrials (Venus retrograde, Mercury 3:2 resonance).

# Q&A
- Q: Which planets have rings?
  A: All gas/ice giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune), but Saturn’s are the most prominent.
- Q: Which body dominates system mass?
  A: The Sun (~99.86% of total mass).
