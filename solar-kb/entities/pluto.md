# Overview
Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt with a thin, seasonally varying nitrogen atmosphere and a binary-like system with its large moon Charon.

# Physical Properties
- Mean radius: ~1,188.3 km
- Mass: ~1.309 × 10^22 kg
- Surface gravity: ~0.62 m/s^2
- Rotation period: ~6.39 Earth days (tidally locked with Charon)
- Axial tilt: ~119.6° (retrograde)
- Day length (solar day): ~6.39 Earth days
- Equatorial daylight duration: ~3.2 Earth days (varies with high obliquity)
- Surface temperature: ~33–55 K (~-240 to -218 °C), seasonally variable

# Orbit
- Semi-major axis: ~39.5 AU (~5.906 billion km)
- Orbital period: ~248 Earth years
- Eccentricity: ~0.2488
- Inclination: ~17.16°
- Mean distance from Sun: ~39.5 AU (varies strongly with eccentricity)

# Atmosphere
Thin N2 with CH4 and CO; pressure and haze vary seasonally with distance and insolation.

# Composition (bulk)
Ice–rock mixture; surface ices include N2, CH4, and CO; large proportion of volatile ices compared to rocky planets.

# Weather & Climate
Seasonal sublimation/condensation of nitrogen and methane ices; hazes producing layered atmosphere; possible localized snows.

# Moons & Rings
Five moons: Charon (largest), Styx, Nix, Kerberos, Hydra; no known rings.

# Exploration
New Horizons flyby (2015) revealed diverse geology, including Sputnik Planitia’s nitrogen-ice plain and young surfaces.

# Notable Facts
- Charon is so large relative to Pluto that the barycenter lies outside Pluto’s surface.

# Weight Of 1 kg Earth Mass
- Scale reading: ~0.06 kgf (0.62/9.81)

# Q&A
- Q: Why is Pluto a dwarf planet?
  A: It does not clear its orbital neighborhood, a criterion for full planetary status.
- Q: What did New Horizons discover?
  A: Complex geology, nitrogen-ice plains, and atmospheric hazes.
