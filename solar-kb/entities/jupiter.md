# Overview
Jupiter is the largest planet and a gas giant with powerful storms, including the Great Red Spot. It has a strong magnetic field and dozens of moons, four of which are the large Galilean satellites.

# Physical Properties
- Mean radius: ~69,911 km
- Mass: ~1.898 × 10^27 kg
- Surface gravity: ~24.79 m/s^2 (at 1 bar level)
- Rotation period: ~9 h 56 m (differential by latitude)
- Day length (solar day): ~9 h 56 m (at cloud tops)
- Equatorial daylight duration: ~4 h 58 m (conceptually half a rotation; sunlight weak at distance)
- Axial tilt: ~3.1°
- Cloud-top temperature: ~-145 °C (varies with altitude)

# Orbit
- Semi-major axis: ~5.204 AU (~778 million km)
- Orbital period: ~11.86 Earth years
- Eccentricity: ~0.0489
- Inclination: ~1.3°
- Mean distance from Sun: ~5.20 AU

# Atmosphere
~90% H2, ~10% He (by volume) with trace CH4, NH3, H2O, H2S; complex banded structure and storms.

# Composition (bulk)
Primarily hydrogen and helium with a deep atmosphere overlying layers of metallic hydrogen; likely rocky/icy core.

# Weather & Climate
Alternating jet streams, long-lived vortices (Great Red Spot), lightning, and powerful convective storms; strong internal heat flux.

# Moons & Rings
>80 known moons; Galilean: Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto. Faint ring system of dust.

# Exploration
Pioneer, Voyager, Galileo orbiter, Juno (in orbit), JUICE en route.

# Notable Facts
- Ganymede is the Solar System’s largest moon; Europa likely has a subsurface ocean.

# Weight Of 1 kg Earth Mass
- Scale reading: ~2.53 kgf (24.79/9.81) at the 1 bar level

# Q&A
- Q: What is the Great Red Spot?
  A: A long-lived anticyclonic storm larger than Earth.
- Q: Does Jupiter have rings?
  A: Yes, a faint dust ring system.
