# Overview
Venus is Earth-sized but has a dense CO2 atmosphere with sulfuric-acid clouds, producing a powerful greenhouse effect and extreme surface conditions.

# Physical Properties
- Mean radius: ~6,051.8 km
- Mass: ~4.867 × 10^24 kg
- Surface gravity: ~8.87 m/s^2
- Density: ~5.24 g/cm^3
- Rotation period (sidereal): ~243 Earth days (retrograde)
- Day length (solar day): ~116.75 Earth days (retrograde)
- Equatorial daylight duration: ~58.4 Earth days (thick clouds block sunlight at surface)
- Axial tilt: ~177.4° (retrograde spin)
- Surface pressure: ~92 bar; mean temperature ~735 K (~462 °C)

# Orbit
- Semi-major axis: ~0.723 AU (~108.2 million km)
- Orbital period: ~224.7 Earth days
- Eccentricity: ~0.0068
- Inclination: ~3.4°
- Mean distance from Sun: ~0.72 AU

# Atmosphere
~96.5% CO2, ~3.5% N2, with global cloud decks of H2SO4 droplets.

# Composition (bulk)
Rocky silicate mantle and crust over an iron core; very dry surface with negligible liquid water.

# Weather & Climate
Global super-rotating winds; sulfuric-acid clouds; near-isothermal surface due to extreme greenhouse effect; minimal diurnal variation.

# Moons & Rings
None known.

# Exploration
Venera landers; Magellan (radar mapping); Venus Express; Akatsuki; upcoming VERITAS/EnVision missions.

# Notable Facts
- Despite being farther from the Sun than Mercury, Venus is hotter due to its greenhouse atmosphere.

# Weight Of 1 kg Earth Mass
- Scale reading: ~0.90 kgf (8.87/9.81)

# Q&A
- Q: Why is Venus so hot?
  A: Its dense CO2 atmosphere traps heat via the greenhouse effect.
- Q: Does Venus rotate backwards?
  A: Yes, it has retrograde rotation (east-to-west).
