# Overview
Earth’s Moon is a large, airless world that is tidally locked, always showing the same face to Earth. Its phases result from changing Sun–Earth–Moon geometry.

# Physical Properties
- Mean radius: ~1,737.4 km
- Mass: ~7.342 × 10^22 kg
- Surface gravity: ~1.62 m/s^2
- Density: ~3.34 g/cm^3
- Rotation period: ~27.32 days (synchronous with its orbital period)
- Day length (solar day): ~29.53 Earth days (synodic)
- Equatorial daylight duration: ~14.77 Earth days
- Axial tilt: ~6.7° to its orbit; ~1.5° to ecliptic (varies by definition)

# Orbit
- Mean distance: ~384,400 km
- Orbital period (sidereal): ~27.32 days; synodic (phase-to-phase): ~29.53 days
- Eccentricity: ~0.0549
- Inclination: ~5.1° to the ecliptic

# Atmosphere
Extremely tenuous exosphere (Na, K, Ar, He).

# Composition (bulk)
Silicate crust and mantle with a small iron core; widespread regolith layer from impacts.

# Weather & Climate
No atmosphere-driven weather; large temperature swings (day up to ~127 °C, night down to ~-173 °C); electrostatically levitated dust.

# Exploration
Apollo landings; Luna/Chang’e missions; LRO, GRAIL, Chandrayaan, and others.

# Notable Facts
- Tidal locking causes the same hemisphere to face Earth.
- Eclipses occur when Sun–Earth–Moon align near nodes (rare alignment).

# Weight Of 1 kg Earth Mass
- Scale reading: ~0.17 kgf (1.62/9.81)

# Q&A
- Q: Why do we always see the same lunar face?
  A: Tidal locking synchronizes rotation and orbital periods.
- Q: What causes lunar phases?
  A: The angle between Sun, Earth, and Moon changes illumination.
