# Overview
Neptune is an ice giant known for strong winds and dynamic storms (e.g., Great Dark Spot events). It is deep blue due to methane absorption and haze particles.

# Physical Properties
- Mean radius: ~24,622 km
- Mass: ~1.024 × 10^26 kg
- Surface gravity: ~11.15 m/s^2
- Rotation period: ~16.1 h (differential)
- Day length (solar day): ~16.1 h
- Equatorial daylight duration: ~8.05 h (conceptually half a rotation)
- Axial tilt: ~28.3°
- Cloud-top temperature: ~-214 °C (59 K)

# Orbit
- Semi-major axis: ~30.05 AU (~4.495 billion km)
- Orbital period: ~164.8 Earth years
- Eccentricity: ~0.0086
- Inclination: ~1.77°
- Mean distance from Sun: ~30.1 AU

# Atmosphere
~80% H2, ~19% He, ~1–2% CH4 (by volume); high-speed jet streams and episodic large storms.

# Composition (bulk)
Ice giant with significant water, ammonia, and methane ices beneath the atmosphere; likely rocky core.

# Weather & Climate
Fastest winds in the Solar System (>1,500 km/h); transient Great Dark Spot-type storms; strong internal heat.

# Moons & Rings
14 known moons (notably Triton, a likely captured Kuiper Belt object); faint ring arcs.

# Exploration
Voyager 2 flyby (1989). No orbiter yet.

# Notable Facts
- Triton has geysers and retrograde orbit, supporting a capture origin.

# Weight Of 1 kg Earth Mass
- Scale reading: ~1.14 kgf (11.15/9.81)

# Q&A
- Q: What causes Neptune’s blue color?
  A: Methane absorbs red light; remaining blue/green is scattered and reflected.
- Q: Is Triton a typical moon?
  A: No, its retrograde orbit suggests it was captured from the Kuiper Belt.
