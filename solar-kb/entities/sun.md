# Overview
The Sun is a G2V main-sequence star that powers the Solar System through nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. It contains about 99.86% of the Solar System’s mass and governs the motion, climate, and space weather affecting all planets.

# Physical Properties
- Mean radius: ~696,340 km
- Mass: ~1.989 × 10^30 kg
- Surface gravity: ~274 m/s^2
- Effective temperature: ~5,778 K
- Luminosity: ~3.828 × 10^26 W
- Composition: ~73% H, ~25% He (by mass), traces of heavier elements
- Rotation period: ~24–35 days (differential; faster at equator, slower at poles)

# Structure (simplified)
- Core → Radiative zone → Convective zone → Photosphere → Chromosphere → Corona

# Activity
- Solar cycle: ~11 years (sunspots, flares, coronal mass ejections) driving space weather.

# Weather & Climate (Stellar)
Differential rotation, convection-driven granulation, sunspot cycles, flares, and coronal mass ejections; solar wind varies with magnetic activity.

# Exploration
- Notable missions: SOHO, SDO, Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter.

# Notable Facts
- The Sun’s differential rotation is faster at the equator than at the poles.
- Solar wind creates the heliosphere and drives auroras on magnetized planets.

# Q&A
- Q: What type of star is the Sun?
  A: A G2V main-sequence (yellow dwarf) star.
- Q: What powers the Sun’s energy output?
  A: Nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core.
