# Overview
Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet. It has a heavily cratered surface, a large iron core, and an extremely tenuous exosphere rather than a substantial atmosphere.

# Physical Properties
- Mean radius: ~2,439.7 km
- Mass: ~3.301 × 10^23 kg
- Surface gravity: ~3.7 m/s^2
- Density: ~5.43 g/cm^3
- Rotation period (sidereal): ~58.65 Earth days (3:2 spin–orbit resonance)
- Day length (solar day): ~176 Earth days
- Equatorial daylight duration: ~88 Earth days (varies by latitude)
- Axial tilt: ~0.03°
- Typical surface temperature: day up to ~430 °C (703 K), night down to ~-180 °C (93 K)

# Orbit
- Semi-major axis: ~0.387 AU (~57.9 million km)
- Orbital period: ~87.97 Earth days
- Eccentricity: ~0.2056
- Inclination: ~7.0° to the ecliptic
- Mean distance from Sun: ~0.39 AU

# Atmosphere
Exosphere of Na, K, He, and trace gases sourced from surface sputtering and solar wind.

# Composition (bulk)
Silicate rock crust and mantle over a disproportionately large iron core.

# Weather & Climate
No true weather system; extreme day–night temperature swings; micro-meteoroid gardening of regolith.

# Moons & Rings
None known.

# Exploration
Mariner 10; MESSENGER (global mapping); BepiColombo (en route/orbit phase timeline dependent).

# Notable Facts
- Solar day (noon-to-noon) is ~176 Earth days due to the 3:2 resonance.

# Weight Of 1 kg Earth Mass
- Scale reading: ~0.38 kgf (3.7/9.81)

# Q&A
- Q: Why is Mercury’s day so long?
  A: Its 3:2 spin–orbit resonance makes the solar day ~176 Earth days.
- Q: Does Mercury have an atmosphere?
  A: Only a very thin exosphere, not a stable, dense atmosphere.
