# Overview
Saturn is a gas giant known for its extensive and bright ring system composed primarily of water-ice particles. It has a strong magnetic field and many moons, including Titan and Enceladus.

# Physical Properties
- Mean radius: ~58,232 km
- Mass: ~5.683 × 10^26 kg
- Surface gravity: ~10.44 m/s^2 (at 1 bar level)
- Rotation period: ~10.7 h (varies by method/latitude)
- Day length (solar day): ~10.7 h (cloud tops)
- Equatorial daylight duration: ~5.35 h (conceptually half a rotation)
- Axial tilt: ~26.7°
- Cloud-top temperature: ~-178 °C (varies with altitude)

# Orbit
- Semi-major axis: ~9.58 AU (~1.434 billion km)
- Orbital period: ~29.46 Earth years
- Eccentricity: ~0.0565
- Inclination: ~2.5°
- Mean distance from Sun: ~9.58 AU

# Atmosphere
~96% H2, ~3% He (by volume) with trace CH4, NH3, H2O; banded but more subtle than Jupiter.

# Composition (bulk)
Dominantly hydrogen and helium; probable rocky/icy core; helium rain may deplete upper-atmospheric He.

# Weather & Climate
Banded jets, episodic giant storms (Great White Spots), polar hexagon vortex at the north pole; strong seasonal ring-shadow effects.

# Moons & Rings
>80 moons; Titan (thick N2 atmosphere, methane cycle) and Enceladus (geysers). Prominent ring system (A, B, C plus faint rings).

# Exploration
Pioneer, Voyager, Cassini–Huygens (long-term orbital study; Titan lander).

# Notable Facts
- Rings are mostly centimeter-to-meter ice; gaps and spokes show complex dynamics.

# Weight Of 1 kg Earth Mass
- Scale reading: ~1.06 kgf (10.44/9.81) at the 1 bar level

# Q&A
- Q: What are Saturn’s rings made of?
  A: Primarily water-ice particles with some dust and rock.
- Q: Why are Saturn’s rings so visible?
  A: High albedo ice and wide, dense ring planes.
