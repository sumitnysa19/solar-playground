# Overview
Mars is a cold, desert world with polar ice caps, thin CO2 atmosphere, and evidence of ancient water flows. It hosts the largest volcano (Olympus Mons) and canyon system (Valles Marineris) in the Solar System.

# Physical Properties
- Mean radius: ~3,389.5 km
- Mass: ~6.417 × 10^23 kg
- Surface gravity: ~3.71 m/s^2
- Density: ~3.93 g/cm^3
- Rotation period: ~24.62 h (a "sol")
- Day length (solar day): ~24 h 39 m 35 s
- Equatorial daylight duration: ~12 h 20 m at equinox (varies seasonally)
- Axial tilt: ~25.2°
- Typical surface temperature: ~-125 °C (polar winter) to ~20 °C (equatorial summer); mean ~-60 °C

# Orbit
- Semi-major axis: ~1.524 AU (~228 million km)
- Orbital period: ~686.98 Earth days
- Eccentricity: ~0.0934
- Inclination: ~1.85°
- Mean distance from Sun: ~1.52 AU

# Atmosphere
~95% CO2, ~2.6% N2, ~1.9% Ar; thin, variable pressure; frequent dust storms.

# Composition (bulk)
Basaltic crust and mantle with iron oxides (reddish dust); water-ice and CO2 ice at poles; hydrated minerals.

# Weather & Climate
Planet-encircling dust storms in some years; seasonal CO2 polar cap growth/retreat; thin clouds and dust devils common.

# Moons & Rings
Two small moons: Phobos and Deimos; no rings.

# Exploration
Viking, MRO, MAVEN, Curiosity, Perseverance, Ingenuity, ExoMars TGO, and others.

# Notable Facts
- Seasonal CO2 deposition at poles; recurring slope lineae and deltas indicate past liquid water.

# Weight Of 1 kg Earth Mass
- Scale reading: ~0.38 kgf (3.71/9.81)

# Q&A
- Q: How long is a Martian day?
  A: About 24.6 hours, called a sol.
- Q: Does Mars have liquid water now?
  A: Surface liquid water is unstable; ice and transient brines may exist.
