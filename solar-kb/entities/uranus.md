# Overview
Uranus is an ice giant with a unique ~98° axial tilt, causing extreme seasonal effects. It has a cold, hazy atmosphere and a system of dark rings and moons.

# Physical Properties
- Mean radius: ~25,362 km
- Mass: ~8.681 × 10^25 kg
- Surface gravity: ~8.69 m/s^2
- Rotation period: ~17.2 h (retrograde definition varies)
- Day length (solar day): ~17.2 h (retrograde)
- Equatorial daylight duration: ~8.6 h (conceptually half a rotation; extreme seasonal illumination due to tilt)
- Axial tilt: ~97.8° (rotates "on its side")
- Cloud-top temperature: ~-224 °C (49 K)

# Orbit
- Semi-major axis: ~19.2 AU (~2.872 billion km)
- Orbital period: ~84.0 Earth years
- Eccentricity: ~0.0472
- Inclination: ~0.77°
- Mean distance from Sun: ~19.2 AU

# Atmosphere
~82% H2, ~15% He, ~2% CH4 (approx., by volume); methane absorption gives blue-green color; very low intrinsic heat.

# Composition (bulk)
Ice giant: large fractions of water, ammonia, and methane ices mixed with hydrogen and helium; likely rocky core.

# Weather & Climate
Generally bland appearance with occasional storms; strong axial tilt drives extreme seasons; narrow ring shadows and polar hood features.

# Moons & Rings
27+ moons (Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, Miranda); dark, narrow ring system.

# Exploration
Only flyby: Voyager 2 (1986). Future flagship mission under study.

# Notable Facts
- The extreme tilt likely resulted from a giant impact or cumulative interactions early in history.

# Weight Of 1 kg Earth Mass
- Scale reading: ~0.89 kgf (8.69/9.81)

# Q&A
- Q: Why is Uranus tilted?
  A: Likely from a giant impact or series of impacts early on.
- Q: Why is Uranus so cold?
  A: It emits little internal heat compared to other giants.
